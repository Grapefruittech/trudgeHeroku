all\n\n\nSo this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop picked the \"Truth\" beat for Beanie and I was in the session with him\nI had my demo with me, you know, like I always do\nI play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me,\" he's like \"Oh, well okay\"\nUh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID\nAnd No ID told him, \"Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n(Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap)\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer\n(I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper)\nI'm like \"Oh shit\"\nI was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also\nPeople were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game\nIf it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here\nSo you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that\nI was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off layaway, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample\nI played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy, Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the Dynasty\"\nAnd at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me\nSo I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time and really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with it sped up, sampled\nAnd now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't be Life\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album\nI could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management\nI really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level\nAnd that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude\"\n(Oh you a real soulful dude, man)\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take\nAnd he said, \"Tell me what you think of this\"\n(Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)\nAnd I heard it, and I was thinking like, \"Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z\"\nI ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion\nSo he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n(So what you think of this?)\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight\"\nYou know what I'm sayin', man what I'mma tell him?\nI was on the train, man, you know\nSo after that I went back home and man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing\nYou know, I got groups, I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like, poppin' off the way it should have been\nOne of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed\nBut it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company\nSo, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company\nAnd I got evicted at the same time\nSo I went down and tracked the beats from him\nI took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out\nSo I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk\nMe and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey\n(Come on, let's just go)\nI hadn't even seen my apartment\nI remember I pulled up, I unpacked all my shit\n(Kanye, baby, we're here)\nYou know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself\nI loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City\"\nAnd Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats\nAnd, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time\nBut then Jay walked in, I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on\nI remember it like, like it was yesterday\nAnd Hip Hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him\"\nSo I played \"Heart of the City\" and really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n(No I think Jay gon' like this one right here)\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat and I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, \"Ooh\"\nTwo days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame\nDame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo, what's up I'm Kanye\"\n(Yo, you that kid, Kanye?)\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to beats G\"\n(Yo, Jay got classics, G)\nYou know I ain't talkin shit\nI'm like, \"Oh shit\"\nAnd all this time, I'm starstruck, man, I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes and they still are, you know\nSo, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days\nI gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story\nThe day I did the 'Can't Be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S., he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly\nAnd Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people\nI didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"Yo Jay I could rap\"\nAnd I spit this rap that said, uh, \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit\nMayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips\"\nAnd I saw his eyes light up when I said that line\nBut you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response, he said, \"Man, that was tight\"\n(That, that was cool, that was hot)\nThat was it, you know, I ain't get no deal then, haha\nOkay, fast forward\nSo, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single\nAnd I just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper\nBecause, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him\nMan, yo, I appreciate, I love him for that\nAnd at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats\n\"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z,\" You know, they dick riders, whatever\nSo I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll\nBe like, \"Yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever\nEverybody out there listen here, I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me\nYou know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say \"Naw\"\nLike, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels, Jessica Rivera, man\n(Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real)\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n(Y'all niggas is stupid)\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal\nThe nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know?\nThe person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records\nHe wanted to sign me really bad\n(We gonna change the game, buddy)\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack\"\n(You gotta make sure it's not wack)\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and\nDame was in the room\nSo I played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it\nSo, it's called \"Wow\"\n\"I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got eleven plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow,\" like the chorus went\nDon't bite that chorus, I might still use it\nSo I play that song for him, and he's like, \"Oh shit\"\n(Oh shit, it's not even wack)\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot\"\n(It's actually kinda hot)\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper\nAnd I'm sure Dame figured, \"Like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know\nSo uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"Yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n(You don't wanna catch a brick)\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on\"\nI told Hip Hop and Hip Hop was all, \"Oh, word?\"\nActually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H\nThat, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do\nThen, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"Oh he's just a producer rapper\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right\nThe day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do man, I had picked out clothes\nI already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go\nAnd they had Mel call me, they said, \"Yo\nCapitol pulled on the deal\"\n(Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal)\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested\nAnd I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever\nI went up\nI called G, I said, \"Man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?",
